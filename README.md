Build the Angular project

Deploy the app on Vercel

Verify that the app is online (HTTP 200 check)

Example GitHub Actions workflow:
(see .github/workflows/deploy.yml)

yaml
Code kopieren
- name: Verify deployment (HTTP 200)
  run: |
    DEPLOY_URL="https://subtrack-app.vercel.app"
    STATUS_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $DEPLOY_URL)
    if [ $STATUS_CODE -eq 200 ]; then
      echo "✅ Deployment successful ($STATUS_CODE)"
    else
      echo "❌ Deployment failed ($STATUS_CODE)"
      exit 1
    fi
